/* This is a pattern-matching construct.
 * Only those fields specified will be checked against the 
 * return value of hover().
 * A field with the '?' means that the check will succeed if
 * either the field's value matches or the field is not present.
 * Without the '?' the check would fail if the field is not present.
 * 
 * The algorithm is simple and recursive: the value on the LHS 
 * matches the return value if all keys mentioned are present,
 * and their values match the associated values of RHS.
 *
 * In this example, `hover()` is a builtin function that corresponds
 * to the `textDocument/hover` method call invoked by the client to
 * the server. Here the two arguments are the line and character.
